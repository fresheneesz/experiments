-- troubleshooting questions --

* We run multiple servers (2 at the moment - used to be more), which are behind a load balancer. We have a video ad system that records how far along a user is in a video (at regular intervals). Currently, when a request to update the record comes in, we grab the row if there is one, change it, and update the db (and if there isn't one, we create it). We're sometimes seeing duplicate rows created in the database. Why would this be and how would you solve it?

* we had some issues with deadlocks happening on insert of a row for a particular table. How would you debug this issue?

* We're faced with being closed off from our production database as developers, meaning we couldn't search and modify production data because of PII. What problems could arrise from this limitation and how would you suggest we work around it?

-- SQL --

Given table A and B where A has the rows id,name and B has the rows id,location and ids match for a give. Lets say that for every row in table B there is always a row in table A, but not vice versa
* write a select that selects all the info for every person named 'ted'
* write a select that selects all the info for every person in the location 'canada'

Lets say you want to build a message board where messages can nest. Each message has an author, date, message-body. We want to store this message nesting hierarchy in the database.
* How would you design the schema for this?
* How would you select all the messages that replied to a given message (given its ID)?
* (if the answer didn't include nested child messages, ask about how to select those as well)
* could we simplify things if we limited nesting to 3 levels or something?
* how might that change things?
