To run

1. Find where nw.exe is installed (I put it in C:/node-webkit)
2. (for windows) Drag the folder containing the package.json onto nw.exe 

To build a single-file you can run in the same way as the folder:

1. create a zip file of the source files (main.html, package.json, and any supporting js)
2. rename it to have the extension .nw

To build an executable (which still requires supporing dlls):

1. Build a single-file nw
2. copy /b nw.exe+yourAppName.nw yourAppName.exe 
3. include all files that nw.exe is installed with (except nw.exe itself) in the same folder
