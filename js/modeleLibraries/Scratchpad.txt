Statics requests to:
A. perfund server
	* parameters: 
		* request file path - the module you need
		* already loaded modules - the modules the page already has on it (sorted in alphabetical order or something)
	* When a file path is requested
		* if the request file path + already loaded modules is not in the cache:
			* package up the requested modules and their dependencies (minus already loaded modules)
				* Node.js modules
					* maybe convert them to AMD modules??
				* AMD modules?					
				* plain javascript file
					* should be wrapped somehow?
			* put it in the cache
			* return the built package
		* else: 
			* return the cached package
B. external server - AMD module
	* maybe just use an AMD module loader
C. external server - plain javascript file
	* probably have to load it with an xhr request and wrap it (like its wrapped on the server side)


Server-side:

1. Add a global variable for AMD style loading 
2. 

Client side:

1. load html page that has a bundled core javascript package that includes the loader (and other core things)
2. as needed pages will load additional libraries asynchronously via AMD style stuff
