Requirements:

* client-side code declares explicit modules it requires (just like node.js, but doesn't have to be in the node.js way [CommonJS module spec])
* browser can incrimentally load more modules as needed (doesn't have to load all the javascript up front)
* browser can load modules asynchronously (no calls that stop the world)
* incrementally loaded modules don't send over modules already loaded in the browser again (they reuse stuff already on the browser when possible)
* I can share modules between node.js and client-code seamlessly (any transformation must be done automatically with a repeatable process - which would have to be done anytime the module changes)
* The ability to load regular javascript (like jquery) that exposes things globally (or on the window object explicitly)

Nice-to-have:

* Ability to optimize script loading (don't make more http requests than you have to)
